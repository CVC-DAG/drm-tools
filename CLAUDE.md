# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Branch Strategy

**Always work on the `develop` branch unless explicitly told otherwise.**

- **`develop`** — Active development branch. All substantial changes, new features, refactors, and bug fixes go here.
- **`main`** — Release branch. Only minor changes for preparing releases (version bumps, changelog entries, doc links). Never add features or make structural changes here.

Before starting any work, check the current branch:
```bash
git branch --show-current
```
If on `main`, switch to `develop` first:
```bash
git checkout develop
```

### New Feature Branch Strategy

When the user indicates they want to add a **new feature**, follow these steps:

1. **Switch to `develop`** — ensure you're on the development branch.
2. **Check for uncommitted changes** — run `git status`.
   - If there are **uncommitted changes** on `develop` that could interfere with the new feature, **propose creating a dedicated feature branch**: `feature/<name>` (e.g., `feature/ontology-import`). Ask the user for confirmation before creating it.
   - If there are **no conflicting changes**, proceed directly on `develop`.
3. **If no uncommitted changes exist** but the user has work-in-progress from previous sessions that is not yet committed, ask about it before proceeding.

This ensures new features are developed in isolation when there are active changes on `develop` that might conflict.

## Development Workflow

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Follow a strict TDD cycle for all new features and substantial changes:

1. **Write tests first** — Before any implementation, write failing tests that define the expected behavior.
2. **Run tests and confirm failure** — Verify the tests fail (red phase).
3. **Implement the feature** — Write the minimum code to make the tests pass.
4. **Run tests and confirm success** — Verify all tests pass (green phase).
5. **Refactor** — Clean up code while keeping tests passing.

Never implement code without corresponding tests. If a test fails, fix the implementation — never lower test expectations.

### Commit Discipline

**Never commit changes unless explicitly asked.** Only commit when the user says "fes el commit", "commit", "commit and push", or similar. Do not auto-commit after completing tasks.

### Daily Commit Policy

If the repository has uncommitted changes from previous days when you start working, the first commit of the day must be split into two:

1. **First commit** — Stage and commit all changes from previous days with a message like `chore: daily commit — <date>` summarizing what was done.
2. **Second commit** — Stage and commit only the changes made during the current session with a descriptive message about today's work.

Check for existing uncommitted changes at the start of each session:
```bash
git status
```
If there are staged or unstaged changes, ask the user for the date they were made and split the commit accordingly.

## Development Commands

### Installation
- Install in editable mode: `pip install -e .`

### Testing
- Run all tests: `python -m pytest test/ -v`
- Run a single test file: `python -m pytest test/<test_file_name>.py`

### Documentation
- Generate HTML documentation with Sphinx:
  `sphinx-build -b html docs/ docs/_build/html/`
  (Or use the virtual environment: `.venv/bin de sphinx-build -b html docs/ docs/_build/html/`)

## Architecture & Core Concepts

### Overview
This library implements a graph-based document representation model. It supports two backends: `Neo4jGraph` for persistent storage in Neo4j and `NetworkXGraph` for lightweight in-memory testing.

### Core Data Models
- **Node**: The fundamental building block, consisting of a `main_label` and a `pk` (primary key).
- **WeakNode**: A node whose identity is tied to a parent. Its `pk` is a composite of the parent's `pk` and its own. This models hierarchical structures like *Document $\rightarrow$ Section $\rightarrow$ Page*.
- **Relation**: A typed edge connecting two nodes.
- **WeakRelation**: A relation between a parent and a `WeakNode` that carries a `_propagate=True` flag, enabling **cascade delete** (deleting the parent automatically deletes the child).

### IMPORTANT: Backend Integrity
- **DO NOT MODIFY** the core logic, functions, or internal implementation of the Neo4j backend (specifically files in `cvcdocdb/` and `test/test_neo4j_real.py`) unless explicitly instructed to do so within a dedicated, isolated branch and for a specific, documented task.
- Any structural changes to the backend must follow a formal review process.

## PyPI Publishing

**NEVER publish to PyPI automatically.** Only publish when explicitly asked by the user.

- Do not run `twine upload`, `python -m build`, or `pip install --upload` without explicit user instruction
- Do not suggest publishing as part of a "next step" or "todo"
- Publishing is a manual, user-initiated action — the user will say "publica al PyPI" or similar
- Always confirm the version number before publishing

## Key Concepts
- **Semantic Entities**: Domain-specific node types (e.g., `IndividuPadro`, `LlocPadro`) defined within the graph.
- **Cascade Delete**: Enabled by `WeakNode` and `WeakRelation` via the `_propagate` flag.
- **Backends**:
    - `Neo4jGraph`: Full Neo4j integration.
    - `NetworkXGraph`: In-memory implementation for testing.
